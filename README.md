Moka Icon Theme
===============

Moka is a stylized Linux desktop icon set, and the titular icon theme of the [Moka Project](http://snwh.org/moka/). They are designed to be clear, simple and consistent.

This is just my fork where I added some icons I found to be missing (mostly jetbrains products).

The source for the original Moka Icon Theme can be found [here](https://github.com/moka-project/moka-icon-theme).

Alternatively, you can clone the latest version its git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/moka-project/moka-icon-theme.git
